# pyPathfinding
pyPathfinding is a project that shows and builds on how the A* algorithm works and can be implemented into games easily. To run the examples download the repository and open examples.py, uncomment the example you want to use and run examples.py.
# Examples
There are already 2 pre-built examples of how you can use A* to allow AI to nagivate through a map. Another example shows how A star can be done in real time by allowing you to place walls and the algorithm will update itself
