# pyPathfinding
pyPathfinding is a project that shows and builds on how the A* algorithm works and can be implemented into games easily. To run the examples download the repository and open examples.py, uncomment the example you want to use and run examples.py.

# Examples
There are already 2 pre-built examples of how you can use A* to allow AI to nagivate through a map. Another example shows how A star can be done in real time by allowing you to place walls and the algorithm will update itself
Examples:
1. simple - Simple is a simple useage of A* that allows the placing and walls and updating the A star solution upon doing so. To run uncomment simple() at the bottom of examples.py
2. aiexample - Aiexmaple is a function that uses the AI.py file that allows a AI to find a path to a position and wander around the map in a roi (region of interest). To run aiexample uncomment aiexmaple() at the bottom of the examples.py file
